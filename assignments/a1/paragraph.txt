Using triangles, rectangles, and ellipses as my building blocks, I created this simple image.
I start every day with a cup of coffee, represented here with pixelated edges and rudimentary shading.
Behind the cup extends a colorful, gradient background: the rest of my day, a color-filled canvas, is unlocked by this cup of coffee.
